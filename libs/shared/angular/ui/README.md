# shared-angular-ui

This library was generated with [Nx](https://nx.dev).

## Structure and Use
This lib contains all the shared presentational components that can be used in different applications. Think about dropdowns, datepickers and empty modals. A user-detail component for instance does NOT belong here (Put in Features Library). A monorepo can contain multiple ui libraries. We should name them according to its purpose. E.g ui-kit-mobile is a common use case.

## Running unit tests

Run `nx test shared-angular-ui` to execute the unit tests.
